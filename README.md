# Spring-Hackathon; Team Orion 
## What does this project do?
This project is informing people about ideas for the future. 
## How we built it?
We have different pages that go into depht about each idea with 3 visuals and a brief explaination of the idea.
## Challenges we ran into:
Agreeing on the topic, making the pictures float, transitions of the pages, the context in the pages, and finalizing the project to this final stage were some of the challenges we faced.
## What we learned:
We learned how to perserve and how important teamwork is. We also learned what line breaks are and how to bring attributes from variables.
## What is next for this project?
We should be able to make profiles for the go fund me pages and actually make the future become a reality.
