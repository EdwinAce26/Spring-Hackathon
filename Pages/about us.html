        We are students from P-TECH. 
        Pathways in technology Early College High School. 
        We are a small group of Script Ed students. 
        Our task was to build a project on what we see in the future or what we want in the future. 
        So first off we started on a list of random ideas (even the craziest of ideas), 
        ones that comes to mind then we wrote it down. Once we had 15 ideas we then chose at least 5 of those and then crossed the rest out. Finally, we ended up voting. It was between a idea called build/adopt a kid or security. We still couldnâ€™t pick so we came up with an idea that we should create a website that people can view amazing ideas and donate money to make these ideas come true.
